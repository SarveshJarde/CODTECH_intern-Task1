- Overview Of the Project

1. Objetive :
sentiment analysis using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks on IMDB movie reviews. Discover the power 
of LSTM models in natural language processing as we walk you through the entire process—from data preprocessing
to model training and evaluation.

2. Key Activitys :

- Data Collection
Collect IMDB movie reviews dataset. This dataset typically consists of movie reviews along with their associated sentiment labels (e.g., positive or negative).

-Data Preprocessing
Text Cleaning: Remove noise from the text data, such as HTML tags, special characters, and unnecessary punctuation.
Tokenization: Split the text into tokens (words or subwords). This can be done using libraries like NLTK, SpaCy, or TensorFlow/Keras’s built-in tokenizers.
Normalization: Convert text to lowercase, handle synonyms, and remove stop words if necessary.
Padding/Truncation: Ensure that all sequences (reviews) are of the same length by padding shorter sequences with zeros or truncating longer ones.

- Text Representation
Word Embeddings: Convert tokens into numerical vectors. Commonly used embeddings include Word2Vec, GloVe, or train embeddings from scratch using methods like embedding layers in Keras.
Sequence Preparation: Prepare sequences of embeddings as input data for the LSTM.

- Model Design
Define LSTM Model Architecture: Design the LSTM network. A typical LSTM model for sentiment analysis might include:
Embedding Layer: Converts input tokens into dense vectors.
LSTM Layers: Capture temporal dependencies and context in sequences. You may use one or more LSTM layers, and sometimes add bidirectional LSTMs to capture dependencies from both directions.
Dropout Layers: Implement dropout to prevent overfitting.
Dense Layers: Follow LSTM layers with dense layers to transform LSTM outputs into a desired format.
Output Layer: Typically a sigmoid or softmax layer to produce probabilities for binary or multi-class sentiment classification.

- Model Training
Loss Function and Optimizer: Choose appropriate loss functions (e.g., binary cross-entropy for binary classification) and optimizers
Train Model: Fit the model to the training data. This involves feeding in sequences of embeddings and adjusting weights to minimize the loss.
Validation: Use a validation set to monitor the model's performance during training and avoid overfitting.

- Model Evaluation
Metrics: Evaluate the model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.
Test Data: Assess the model’s performance on a separate test dataset that it hasn’t seen before to gauge its generalization capability.
